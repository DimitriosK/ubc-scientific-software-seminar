    "[JupyterHub](https://pims.jupyter.ca) is a web service provided by the [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS)](http://www.pims.math.ca/) and hosts [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks (such as this document itself) for UBC students, fellows and faculty (via CWL login). When you login to JupyterHub, you see your home directory and various tabs to create files and folders, create notebooks, check which processes are running, etc. Essentially, your JupyterHub account is a Linux machine which is running remotely on a server provided by PIMS and you interact with your remote machine via a browser on your local device.\n",

To get started with a new Jupyter notebook with a Python 3 kernel, click the `New` tab in the top right corner of the JupyterHub main page and then click `Python 3`. This will open a notebook in a new tab in your browser.\n",
