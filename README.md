## UBC Scientific Software Seminar (ubcs3)

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar (ubcs3) is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and its goals are:

* To help students, graduates, fellows and faculty develop software skills for science
* To promote scientific computation, communication and collaboration at UBC and beyond
* To promote open source scientific software development
* To provide an inclusive, professional, harassment-free environment following Software Carpentry's [Code of Conduct](http://software-carpentry.org/conduct/)

### Summer 2016: Collaborative Scientific Computing in Python

#### REGISTER

If you are interested in participating, please complete the following survey: [ubcs3 Summer 2016 Registration](https://survey.ubc.ca/s/scientific-software-seminar-registration/)

#### OUTLINE

* What are the **learning goals**?
  * To develop software skills for managing data files and collaborative software projects with the [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Git/GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * To learn [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming for scientific computing
  * To learn mathematics and statistics applied to data science and machine learning
  * To meet and collaborate with other students and faculty interested in scientific computing
* What **software tools** are we going to use?
  * [Bash Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/): working with the file system from the command line
  * [Git/GitHub](https://github.com/): managing projects locally from the command line using Git and collaborating online with GitHub
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/): datatypes, logic, loops, functions, classes and objects
  * [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/): execute code with accompanying text, markdown and $$LaTeX$$ all in the browser
  * [SciPy Stack](http://scipy.org/): scientific computing with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/): machine learning in Python
* What **scientific topics** will we study?
  * Calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics
  * Data wrangling, analysis and visualization
  * Basic machine learning
* Where do we start? What are the **prerequisites**?
  * Basic calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics
  * Basic programming experience in *any* language (in particular, familiarity with logic, loops and functions)
  * [Web literacy](https://learning.mozilla.org/web-literacy) is assumed but no prior experience with Git/GitHub is required
  * Experience creating, manipulating and navigating files and directories (aka folders) on your own operating system is assumed but no prior experience with the command line is required
* Who is the target **audience**?
  * Everyone is invited!
  * If the outline above is at your level, perfect! Get ready to write a lot of code!
  * If the outline above seems too intimidating, come anyway! You'll learn things just by being exposed to new tools and ideas, and meeting new people!
  * If you have experience with all the topics outlined above, come anyway! You'll become more of an expert by participating as a helper/instructor!

#### SCHEDULE

Summer 2016 will consist of six 3-hour seminars held weekly from mid-July until the end of August:

* Week 1
  * First steps: What is a Jupyter notebook? Git? GitHub? Bash?!!
  * Working with repositories and collaborating on GitHub
  * Bash shell commands for creating files/directories and navigating the file system
  * Python review: datatypes, logic, loops, and functions
* Week 2
  * More Bash commands
  * Work locally: Git on the command line
  * Work collaboratively: Git to GitHub and back again
  * More Python: objects and classes
* Week 3
  * TBD
* Week 4
  * TBD
* Week 5
  * TBD
* Week 6
  * TBD

#### NOTES

* ubcs3 is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and we will tailor SWC's [lessons](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) for a mathematical/statistical audience
* The longterm vision for ubcs3 is to choose a new theme for each Summer, Fall and Winter semester focusing on a different technology
