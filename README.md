## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and its goal is to help students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC develop software skills for science.

### Summer 2016: Collaborative Scientific Computing in Python

#### OUTLINE

* What are the **learning goals**?
  * To develop software skills for managing data files and collaborative software projects with the [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Git/GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * To learn [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming for scientific computing
  * To learn mathematics and statistics applied to data science and machine learning
  * To meet and collaborate with other students and faculty interested in scientific computing
* What **software tools** are we going to use?
  * [Bash Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/): working with the file system from the command line
  * [Git/GitHub](https://github.com/): managing projects locally from the command line using Git and collaborating online with GitHub
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/): datatypes, logic, loops, functions, classes and objects
  * [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/): execute code with accompanying text, markdown and LaTeX all in the browser
  * [SciPy Stack](http://scipy.org/): scientific computing with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/): machine learning in Python
* What **scientific topics** will we study?
  * Calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics
  * Data wrangling, analysis and visualization
  * Basic machine learning
* Where do we start? What are the **prerequisites**?
  * Basic calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics
  * Basic programming experience in *any* language (in particular, familiarity with logic, loops and functions)
  * No prior experience with the command line is required
  * No prior experience with Git/GitHub is required
* Who is the target **audience**?
  * Everyone is invited!
  * If the outline above is at your level, perfect! Get ready to write a lot of code!
  * If the outline above seems too intimidating, come anyway! You'll learn things just by being exposed to new tools and ideas, and meeting new people!
  * If you have experience with all the topics outlined above, come anyway! You'll become more of an expert by participating as a helper/instructor!
